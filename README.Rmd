## Threshold Selection and Uncertainty for Extreme Value Analysis

### What does threshr do?

The `threshr` package deals primarily with the selection of thresholds for use in extreme value models. It also performs predictive inferences about future extreme values. These inferences can either be based on a single threshold or on a weighted average of inferences from multiple thresholds.  The weighting reflects an estimated measure of the predictive performance of the threshold and can incorporate prior probabilities supplied by a user.  At the moment only the simplest case, where the data can be treated as independent identically distributed observations, is considered, as described in [Northrop et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1111/rssc.12159).  Future releases will tackle more general situations.  

### A simple example

The main function in the threshr package is `ithresh`.  It uses Bayesian leave-one-out cross-validation to compare the extreme value predictive ability resulting from the use of each of a user-supplied set of thresholds.  The following code produces a threshold diagnostic plot using a dataset `gom` containing 315 storm peak significant waveheights.  We set a vector `u_vec` of thresholds; call `ithresh`, supplying the data and thresholds; and use then plot the results. In this minimal example (`ithresh` has further arguments) thresholds are judged in terms of the quality of prediction of whether the validation observation lies above the highest threshold in `u_vec` and, if it does, how much it exceeds this highest threshold.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(threshr)
u_vec_gom <- quantile(gom, probs = seq(0, 0.9, by = 0.05))
gom_cv <- ithresh(data = gom, u_vec = u_vec_gom)
plot(gom_cv)
```

### Installation
